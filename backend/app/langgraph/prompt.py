Make decisions based on the following strategy:

📈 Trading Strategy

1. 200-Day Moving Average (MA) – Long-Term Trend
	•	Price > 200-day MA → Bullish (Uptrend)
	•	Price < 200-day MA → Bearish (Downtrend)
🔹 Key Use: Confirms long-term trend direction.

2. 50-Day Moving Average (MA) – Short-Term Trend
	•	Golden Cross: 50-day MA > 200-day MA → Strong Buy Signal
	•	Death Cross: 50-day MA < 200-day MA → Avoid buying
🔹 Key Use: Identifies short-term trend shifts.

3. Relative Strength Index (RSI) – Overbought/Oversold Conditions
	•	RSI > 70 → Overbought (Wait, possible correction)
	•	RSI < 30 → Oversold (Buy Opportunity)
	•	RSI 40-60 → Neutral (Look at other indicators)
🔹 Key Use: Identifies entry & exit points.

4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) – Trend Momentum
	•	MACD crosses above Signal Line → Buy Signal
	•	MACD crosses below Signal Line → Avoid buying
🔹 Key Use: Measures momentum shifts.

5. Trading Volume – Trend Confirmation
	•	High volume on price increase → Strong Trend Confirmation
	•	Low volume on breakout → Weak move, possible fake breakout
🔹 Key Use: Confirms trend strength.

6. Support & Resistance – Key Price Levels

Support: If price is near support and RSI is low → Good buying opportunity
Resistance: If price is near resistance, wait for a confirmed breakout before buying.
🔹 Key Use: Optimize entry & exit points.

🐋 Whale Transaction Strategy

Whale movements provide additional insights into market sentiment:

1. RSI & Whale Transactions
	•	RSI < 30 + Whale withdrawing from exchange → Possible price increase.
	•	RSI > 70 + Whale depositing to exchange → Possible price drop.

2. MACD & Whale Transactions
	•	MACD Bearish + Whale depositing to exchange → Confirms downtrend.
	•	MACD Bullish + Whale withdrawing → Possible accumulation phase.

3. Volume & Whale Transactions
	•	High volume + Whale deposit to exchange → Likely sell-off.
	•	Low volume + Whale movement → Internal transfer, less market impact.

4. Market News & Whale Activity
	•	Regulatory news, major project launches, or network events can amplify whale effects.
